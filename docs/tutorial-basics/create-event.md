# Create and configure an Event

You can collect participation fees, distribute prizes, receive sponsorships and donations to increase the prize pool.

But... How does it work?

If you are an Esport Content Creator and you are raising money for a Prize Pool or creating an Esports Event, you can collect participation fees and donations.

## Create an Event

1. Go to organizer mode and click create Event.
2. Go to the “New Event” card, type the name and accept the Term of service. *Please, read them carefully*.

## Configure the Event

1. Insert your Website and/or Discord URL.

2. Select the participation fee (if any) and decide the end date for the Prize Pool or Event.

3. If you want to **raise money for a charity**, select which one you’d like to help, we will send the money once the Prize Pool is closed and send you the receipt. We provide a list of all the major charities and you can click on learn more to know about their causes. 
If you want to donate to a charity not listed, write us an email at tournaments.organizers@gmail.com and we will do everything possible to help your cause.

4. Define the Prize Pool if any. Select the name and the amount for each Prize Pool.
What if you do not raise enough money to distribute the Prize Pool? Don’t worry, **you can modify the Event or Prize Pool** whenever you want as long as you do not distribute the money. Just go back on *created events*, click *manage* and then *modify*.

5. **Receive donations and sponsorship**. By accepting donations and sponsorships, you will allow players or donors to donate to your event or to increase your Prize Pool. 

6. Click on the little heart to directly **contribute to your own Event**. After selecting the amount of money, you will be redirected to the payment webpage.

7. Click *start*, **copy the link** we provide you on the top of the configuration and… **Monetize your passion!**
